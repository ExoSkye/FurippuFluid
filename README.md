# FurripuFluid

FurripuFluid is a small fluid simulator I'm working on as a hobby, it's based on [Jos Stam's paper](http://www.dgp.toronto.edu/people/stam/reality/Research/pdf/GDC03.pdf) and [MikeAsh's Simulation for Dummies](https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/fluid-simulation-for-dummies.html)

The name comes from the romanization of the word 'flip' in japanese (フリップ), this is because it was originally meant to be a fluid simulator based on the FLIP technique but I never managed to do that.
